# StackCalc
### A simple calculator

StackCalc is a simple calculator that calculates basic 2D shapes' area and circumference,
and later, basic 3D shapes' volume and surface area

  
Supported shapes

	- Rectangle

	- Triangle

- 3D

	- Cube

	- Sphere

  

### Caveat

This project contains `system()` function which may not work on both linux and windows machine at the same time. At the time of initiation, this project supports linux environment. If you want to build to windows, all you gotta do is to replace `system(clear)` with `system(cls)` in some of the source files.

### Caveat 2
Upon git initiation, this project still only support 2D objects, as this is a work in project. Thanks in advance!
